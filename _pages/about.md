Hello! I’m Pengyuan Wei. I’m a postgraduate research student at the University College London, in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ucl-computer-science) and the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/robotics/ucl-robotics-institute-0). I'm a robotics researcher and I have learned a wide range of knowledge in the fields of mechanics, electronics, automation and computers. 

Work and Research
======
I have always been interested in reinforcement learning. Currently, I am focusing on coordination methods for swarm robots. I use reinforcement learning methods to provide solutions for the coordination of swarm robots.
