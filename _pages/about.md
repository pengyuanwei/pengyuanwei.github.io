Hello! I’m Pengyuan Wei. I’m a postgraduate research student at the University College London, in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ucl-computer-science) and the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/robotics/ucl-robotics-institute-0). I'm a robotics researcher and I have learned a wide range of knowledge in the fields of mechanics, electronics, automation and computers. 

<br />

Work and Research
======
I have always been interested in reinforcement learning. Currently, I am focusing on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning methods for multi-robot learning. 

**Keywords of research interest:**
<ul>
<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
<li>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</li>
<li>Multi-Robot Path Planning</li>
</ul>

<br />

Background and History
======
Before I joined UCL, I received my Bachelor's Degree at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 2021, a major in Mechanical Automation; and my Master's Degree at the University of Bristol in 2022, a major in Biorobotics.
